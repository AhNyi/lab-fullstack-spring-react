# Full Stack Web Application with Spring Boot and React

This repository contains a simple full-stack web application built using Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The backend utilizes Spring Boot with MVC architecture, JPA, and Hibernate for interacting with a MySQL database, providing RESTful web service APIs. The frontend is developed with React.js, incorporating Material UI for a sleek user interface, and leveraging React Hooks (useState, useEffect) along with functional components for efficient state management.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:

- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Hibernate
- MySQL Database

### Frontend:

- React.js
- Material UI
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Features

### RESTful Web Services:

- Implementation of RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to handle CRUD operations.

### Database Interaction:

- Integration with MySQL database for storing and retrieving data.

### React.js Frontend:

- User interface development using React.js with Material UI for a modern look and feel.

### State Management:

- Efficient state management in React.js using Hooks (useState, useEffect).

### Data Fetching:

- Utilization of the fetch API (or axios) for consuming RESTful web service APIs.

## How to Run

### Backend:

1. Ensure you have MySQL installed and create the necessary database schema.
2. Configure MySQL properties in the Spring Boot `application.properties` file.
3. Run the Spring Boot application.

### Frontend:

1. Navigate to the 'frontend' directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the React.js application with `npm start`.

## Additional Notes

- Customize the application to suit your needs by modifying the backend and frontend codebase.
- Explore and expand the project by adding more features or integrating additional technologies.
